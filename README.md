## Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** January 2026

This privacy policy applies to the "Don't Touch My Phone" app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by CodeGuard Studios as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

### Information Collection and Use
The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:

**1. Camera Permission**
* **Reason:** The app requires access to your device's camera to capture an image ("Intruder Selfie") when an unauthorized attempt to unlock the device is detected.
* **Storage:** These images are stored **locally** on your device's internal storage. We do not transmit these images to any external server or third party.

**2. Foreground Service & Sensors**
* **Reason:** The app uses a Foreground Service to monitor your device's accelerometer (motion sensor) and charging status even when the app is closed or the screen is locked.
* **Data Use:** Sensor data is processed in real-time to trigger the alarm. This data is not recorded or stored history.

**3. Location Data (If applicable)**
* **Reason:** [Only include this section if you actually use Location for a "Find My Phone" feature. If not, delete this bullet point].

### Data Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information. Since the Application stores data locally on your device, your data remains in your control. We do not sell or trade your data to outside parties.

### Contact Us
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at **[codeguard.studios.contact@gmail.com]**.
